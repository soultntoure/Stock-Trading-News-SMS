STOCK = "TSLA"

STOCK_KEY = "69QX3ONP057NI49Y"
NEWS_KEY = "0c9616339b5d41e9a26fbe02cbb109ae"

## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/query
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price. 

stock_params = {
    "function" : "TIME_SERIES_DAILY",
    "symbol" : STOCK,
    "outputsize" : "compact",
    "apikey" : STOCK_KEY,
}
stock_response = requests.get(STOCK_ENDPOINT, params=stock_params)

daily_data = stock_response.json()['Time Series (Daily)']
data_list = [value for (key,value) in daily_data.items()]

yesterday_data = data_list[0]
yesterday_closing_price = yesterday_data["4. close"]

before_yesterday_data = data_list[1]
before_yesterday_closing_price = before_yesterday_data["4. close"]

positive_difference = abs(float(yesterday_closing_price) - float(before_yesterday_closing_price))
print(positive_difference)
diff_percentage = (positive_difference / float(yesterday_closing_price)) * 100
print(diff_percentage)



## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator
news_params = {
    "apiKey" : NEWS_KEY,
    "qInTitle": COMPANY_NAME,
    "pageSize": 3,
    "sortBy": "publishedAt",
}
news_response = requests.get(NEWS_ENDPOINT, params=news_params)
articles = news_response.json()['articles']
print(articles)


## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
